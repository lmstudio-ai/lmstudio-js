/**
 * A StreamablePromise is a promise-like that is also async iterable. This means you can use it as a
 * promise (awaiting it, using `.then`, `.catch`, etc.), and you can also use it as an async
 * iterable (using `for await`).
 *
 * Notably, as much as it implements the async iterable interface, it is not a traditional iterable,
 * as it internally maintains a buffer and new values are pushed into the buffer by the producer, as
 * oppose to being pulled by the consumer.
 *
 * The async iterable interface is used instead of the Node.js object stream because streams are too
 * clunky to use, and the `for await` syntax is much more ergonomic for most people.
 *
 * If any iterator is created for this instance, an empty rejection handler will be attached to the
 * promise to prevent unhandled rejection warnings.
 *
 * This class is provided as an abstract class and is meant to be extended. Crucially, the `collect`
 * method must be implemented, which will be called to convert an array of values into the final
 * resolved value of the promise.
 *
 * In addition, the constructor of the subclass should be marked as private, and a static method
 * that exposes the constructor, the `finished` method, and the `push` method should be provided.
 *
 * @typeParam TFragment - The type of the individual fragments that are pushed into the buffer.
 * @typeParam TFinal - The type of the final resolved value of the promise.
