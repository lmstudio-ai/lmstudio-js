 * Represents the reason why a prediction stopped. Only the following values are possible:

 *   the `OngoingPrediction` object.
 * - `modelUnloaded`: The model was unloaded during the prediction.
 * - `failed`: An error occurred during the prediction.
 * - `eosFound`: The model predicted an end-of-sequence token, which is a way for the model to
 *   indicate that it "thinks" the sequence is complete.
 * - `stopStringFound`: A stop string was found in the prediction. (Stop strings can be specified
 *   with the `stopStrings` config option. This stop reason will only occur if the `stopStrings`
 *   config option is set to an array of strings.)
 * - `maxPredictedTokensReached`: The maximum number of tokens to predict was reached. (Length limit
 *   can be specified with the `maxPredictedTokens` config option. This stop reason will only occur
 *   if the `maxPredictedTokens` config option is set to a value other than -1.)
 * - `contextLengthReached`: The context length was reached. This stop reason will only occur if the
 *   `contextOverflowPolicy` is set to `stopAtLimit`.
